[*SparkFun High Precision Temperature Sensor TMP117 (Qwiic) (SEN-15805)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15805)

The TMP117 is a high precision temperature sensor with accuracy of up to +/-0.1 degrees Celsius (across the temperature range of -20째C to +50째Cs with no calibration) and an operating temperature range of -55째C to +150째C. It is NIST traceable and verified with equipment that is calibrated to ISO/IEC 17025 accredited standards. It has a very low power consumption with a supply range of 1.8V to 5.5V.

The TMP117 address can be changed with an external jumper to 4 different addresses. There are 4 different conversion modes that it can read from, with continuous conversion, shutdown, and one shot conversion. There is also digital offset for system correction, programmable temperature limits, general-purpose EEPROM, and selectable averaging.
